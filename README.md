# AcademicProjects

Here is a list of some notable projects I made while in university.  
All of them are either written in C or C++, except for the Web Platform project.  
The teaching goal of all projects was to acquire the following skills:

* System Programming (networking, IPC, file handling, ...)
* Software Architecture (Abstraction, Libraries, ...)
* Algorithms (Binary Search, Dijkstra, Insertion Sort, ...)
* Data Structures (AVL Tree, Key-Value map, arrays, lists, ...)
* Parallel Execution Programming (pthreads, CUDA)

## Computer Networks
Written in C, intended only for `Linux`, features 4 `TCP` servers with different architectures and 1 `TCP` client.

## Data Structures
Written in C++, intended for both `Linux` & `Windows`, features an app that manages a .csv record with thousands of companies.

## Object Oriented Programming
Written in C++, intended for both `Linux` & `Windows`, features a text-adventure game about Ships, built with OOP paradigms.

## Simple Linux Shell
Written in C, intended only for `Linux`, features a simplified shell that runs processes.

## Web Courier
Full stack web app, written in HTML5, CSS, PHP, Javascript, JQuery, MySQL.  
Features an online courier system for orders by using QR Codes for processing them.  
Supports utf-8 fully and is designed for greek locale.
